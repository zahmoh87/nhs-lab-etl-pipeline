# NHS Lab ETL Pipeline

This project simulates a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using NHS-style lab test data. It demonstrates how to clean, transform, and visualize healthcare data using Python and Power BI.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas)
- Google Colab
- Power BI Desktop
- CSV files

## 📁 Files
- `lab_results.csv`: Raw mock lab data
- `etl_pipeline.ipynb`: Python notebook for cleaning and transforming data
- `abnormal_summary.csv`: Output summary of abnormal results by lab location

## 📊 Visualizations
The final output was visualized in Power BI as a bar chart showing abnormal result counts per lab.

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, formatting dates)
- Data transformation (flagging abnormal results, grouping)
- ETL logic simulation
- Healthcare domain relevance

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add date-based trends and test type filters
- Explore storing data in SQL or cloud platforms
- Expand to HL7/FHIR integration simulation

This project is part of my transition into data engineering, building on 10+ years of healthcare IT experience.
